Loops
Computers are super efficient at running a large number of simple tasks! As programmers we take advantage of this speed by writing programs that will repeatedly do some task until a certain condition is met.

If I wanted to scan hundreds of books for a word, it would take me a long time! We can write programs to do these kind of tasks in seconds.

Let's think about how we would tell a computer to read a bunch of books. 

First, we can tell the computer to read each book until there are no books left. Then we can tell it to read each page in the book until there are no pages left. Then each word on the page until there are no words left... Each of these can be written in what we call loops.

In pseudocode this might look a little like this:

while we have books
    read book
    while we have pages in this book
        read page
            while we have words on the page
                read word 
In a flow chart, this may look more like this:

 Follow the flow chart and you can see how we read each word until we have no words, read each word until we have no more pages, and read each book until we have no new books.
